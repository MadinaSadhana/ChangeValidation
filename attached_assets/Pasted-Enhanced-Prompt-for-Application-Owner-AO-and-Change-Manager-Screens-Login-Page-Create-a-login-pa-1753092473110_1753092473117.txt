Enhanced Prompt for Application Owner (AO) and Change Manager Screens
Login Page
Create a login page with the following features:
Role Selection:
Provide two roles for login: Change Manager and Application Owner.
Use a dropdown or radio buttons to allow the user to select their role.
Login Button:
A single "Login" button that redirects the user based on the selected role:
If the selected role is Change Manager, redirect to the Change Manager flow (existing screen).
If the selected role is Application Owner, redirect to the AO dashboard (new screen described below).
Application Owner (AO) Dashboard
After logging in as Application Owner, the user is redirected to the AO dashboard. The dashboard should include the following:
Change Request Details:

Display the following information at the top of the dashboard:
Title of the Change Request.
Description of the Change Request.
Change Manager details (e.g., name, contact information).
Status Update Fields:

Pre-Check Status:
A checkbox for "Pass" or "Fail".
A text area for "Remarks".
Post-Check Status:
A checkbox for "Pass" or "Fail".
A text area for "Remarks".
Submit Button:
A button labeled "Submit" to save the status updates.
Edit Functionality:

If the status has already been submitted:
Display the previously entered values in the fields.
Allow the AO to edit the values (checkbox and remarks).
Replace the "Submit" button with an "Update" button to save changes.
Confirmation Pop-Up:

After submitting or updating the status, display a pop-up message:
Message: "Status has been successfully submitted."
Include an "OK" button to close the pop-up.
Change Manager Flow
If the selected role during login is Change Manager, redirect the user to the existing Change Manager screen.
Styling and Format
Use the same styling and format as the Change Manager screens for consistency across both roles.
Ensure the layout is clean and user-friendly:
Place the Change Request details at the top of the AO dashboard.
Position the status update fields below the Change Request details.
Align the "Submit" or "Update" button centrally below the fields.
Ensure the pop-up message is styled to match the application's overall theme.
Example Flow
Login Page:

Provide a dropdown or radio buttons for role selection: Change Manager or Application Owner.
Clicking "Login" redirects the user to the appropriate dashboard:
Change Manager: Redirect to the existing Change Manager screen.
Application Owner: Redirect to the AO dashboard.
Application Owner Dashboard:

Display the Change Request details at the top.
Below that, provide the status update fields:
Pre-Check Status (checkbox for pass/fail and remarks).
Post-Check Status (checkbox for pass/fail and remarks).
Include a "Submit" button for new updates or an "Update" button for editing existing entries.
After Submission:

Display a pop-up message: "Status has been successfully submitted."
Include an "OK" button to close the pop-up.
Re-login:

When the AO logs in again, the previously entered values should be displayed in the fields.
Allow the AO to edit the values if needed and save the changes.
This enhanced prompt ensures a seamless experience for both roles, with tailored dashboards and functionality for each user type. The confirmation pop-up adds a layer of user feedback after submitting or updating the status.
